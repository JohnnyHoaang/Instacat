## Description

Instacat is a social media network for posting and adopting cats. We provide cat adoption and exclusive cat pictures. We are going to focus on the feed features. Our set of customers are cat enjoyers, fosters, people looking to adopt cats.  

## Features
- Has an API route called `api/cat/all` that sends all existing posts in json format from the MongoDB database
- Has an API route `api/cat/id/:id` that sends specific post in json format based on the given `id` parameter from the MongoDB database
- Can add post with an image and a caption to the database through a POST route 

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
